# Campfire Collective PDX

#### _Front End Development/User Interfaces, Part 1: Week 7 - Two-Week Independent Project, 2/22/19_

#### By _**Randee Layosa**_

## Description

_This app is a mock-up site for a pseudo co-working startup that demonstrates my understanding and efficiency in the Web Design Process. The theoretical idea is that artists of any trade can and should feel comfortable in the shared space, and can utilize it to start up or further their business. Upon landing on the home page, visitors can get a feel for the cool atmosphere vibe and look up the types of spaces available to rent, with its corresponding prices. Viewers can easily get a sense of the space and the amenities offered, membership requirements and benefits, and how to become one._

#### _User Personas_
* **Amber**
  * **Bio**: _Female, 32, Founder/CEO of a local startup_
  * **Trade**: _Construction, set design, woodshop_
  * **Needs**: Wants to be able to book office and meeting spaces each week to act as a business hub while she works to expand.
  * **Pain Points**: Being misled by other competing co-working environments about allocated areas as well as being double-booked for said space.
  * **How we can serve**: Our sleek web layout takes the uncertainty out of what is actually being offered, and closely depicts the true atmosphere of the space. Also, the site features a calendar that is live and visible to all, eliminating the chance of double-booking or lost reservation.
* **Ralph**
  * **Bio**: _Male, 40, Freelance Writer_
  * **Trade**: _Copy writing, fashion, blogging_
  * **Needs**: Needs an affordable and readily available space for either an hour of work time or an entire business day. Coffee, break activities, and quiet spaces are essential.
  * **Pain Points**: Co-work spaces are often expensive and non-conducive to a self-employed independent artist's moderate income.
  * **How we can serve**: As seen on the "_Amenities_" page, Campfire Collective has an in-house Coffee bar, Thursday Afternoon Activities, and private spaces available for when a more quiet work area is needed. There are ample open desks located around the premises that are sure to suffice any basic need.
* **Jo**
  * **Bio**: _Non-Binary, 23, Counselor_
  * **Trade**: _Psychology, Queer Studies, Life Coaching_
  * **Needs**: Requires a positive and safe environment that is supportive of all identities. Needs to be able to secure an office space for every week.
  * **Pain Points**: Co-working spaces that are run by non-allies, rude and judgmental users of the shared spaces, an unwelcoming vibe in general and feeling guilty and responsible for (unknowingly) leading clients into such spaces.
  * **How we can serve**: Campfire Collective offers monthly memberships that allow for seamless and guaranteed booking of spaces. Each member is vetted by staff before being allowed to join. The space is also carefully monitored for undesired behaviors. Campfire makes it a point to demonstrate its views on acceptance, inclusivity, and allied support. This information can be seen on the "_Membership_" page.

## Research

#### _How To Accomplish Client's Wants_
* Maintain a clean and modern design, leaning more towards a minimalistic aesthetic.
* Utilize a bright color scheme, pairing with neutral colors as to maintain aesthetic tastefulness.
* Include creative images and photos of people smiling.
* Include verbiage of inclusivity and the amenities offered that cater to a cohesive space.

#### _Outside Inspiration_
* I researched co-working spaces around the Portland area and kept note of what I wanted to emulate and avoid.
  * _The Crossing - layout/aesthetic, color scheme_
  * _CENTRL Office - layout, page info provided_
  * _Liquid Space - amenities block at bottom of page_
  * _WeWork - amenities block_
  * _Urban Office - clean (less clutter), membership page_
  * _Regus - avoid this look (very corporate)_
  * _Collective Agency - calendar page, mobile view look_
