# _Campfire Collective PDX_

#### _Front End Development/User Interfaces, Part 1: Week 7 - Two-Week Independent Project}, 2/22/19_

#### By _**Randee Layosa**_

## Description

_This app is a mock-up site for a pseudo co-working startup that demonstrates my understanding and efficiency in the Web Design Process. The theoretical idea is that artists of any trade can and should feel comfortable in the shared space, and can utilize it to start up or further their business. Upon landing on the home page, visitors can get a feel for the cool atmosphere vibe and look up the types of spaces available to rent, with its corresponding prices. Viewers can easily get a sense of the space and the amenities offered, membership requirements and benefits, and how to become one._
